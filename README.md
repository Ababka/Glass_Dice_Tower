**Glass Dice Tower**

This project was a hobby/ commission project for a coworker.
The name comes from it being a dice tower for any board game, but it’s made out of acrylic. If that wasn’t already cool, I also designed it to have a LED matrix facing up from the base!	The idea was that when you drop dice into the tower, not only would it do its intended function but also sense that the dice were dropped in and light up the “Glass” tower with a color matrix.

The construction of the tower is pretty straight forward, with acrylic walls, steps and an upper floor (which was frosted for better diffusion). There was a 3D printed PLA black base made to hold the tower, the dice catch and the electronics.

The code was made on the Arduino IDE for a Adafruit Trinket 5V with a Lipo battery add-on board, as well as a Lipo battery. In that circuit there's a switch to turn on/off the battery to the board, for stand alone use, and the input button for the tower to “detect” the dice drop. The bottom can be unscrewed to access the brains.

Version two (as far as hardware) I’d like to make the board accessible from the side to allow for easy charging and firmware upgrades. Refinement of the tower couldn’t hurt either. Such as thinker walls, more diffusion areas and more efficient tumbler steps.

As of right now the repo only has the INO file and a VSCode (C++) file that has comments added. In the near future I’ll add photos of the project and the Gcode for the printed base.
